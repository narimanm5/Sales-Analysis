# Sales and Customer Data Visualization

This project aims to provide a visual representation of sales data alongside daily customer counts and working days over a period of several months. By leveraging Matplotlib, stakeholders can gain insights into sales performance and customer engagement metrics, facilitating informed decision-making and business analysis.


## Data Cleaning Process

- **Handling Missing Values**: Any missing values in the sales, daily customer counts, or working days data are addressed using appropriate techniques, such as imputation or removal.
- **Removing Duplicates**: Duplicate entries, if present in the dataset, are removed to avoid skewing the analysis and visualization results.
- **Outlier Detection and Treatment**: Outliers in the data are identified and treated using statistical methods to ensure that they do not unduly influence the visual representation and interpretation of the results.


## Features

- **Dual-Axis Plotting**: Sales data is presented as vertical bars on the primary axis, while daily customer counts and working days are plotted on the secondary axis using distinctive markers.
- **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Before visualization, the project includes a comprehensive data cleaning process to ensure accuracy and reliability in the visual representation. This process involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and addressing any outliers.
- **Annotations for Data Insights**: Annotations are strategically placed on the plot to display the exact values of daily customer counts and working days below the corresponding markers, enhancing data interpretation and facilitating deeper insights.
- **Customizable Visualization**: The plot is highly customizable, allowing users to adjust colors, marker styles, and plot aesthetics according to their preferences.
- **Export Functionality**: The generated plot can be easily exported as an image file for further analysis or inclusion in reports and presentations.

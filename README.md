#Sales and Customer Data Visualization
This project utilizes Matplotlib to visualize sales data alongside daily customer counts and working days over a span of several months. The plot is designed to provide insights into sales performance and customer engagement metrics over time.

Features:
Multi-axis Plotting: Displays sales data as vertical bars on the primary axis, while daily customer counts and working days are plotted on a secondary axis.
Annotations: Annotations are strategically placed on the plot to display daily customer counts and working days below the corresponding markers, enhancing data interpretation and understanding.
Legend and Labels: Legends are added to both axes to identify the datasets being visualized, ensuring clarity in data representation. Axes labels and a title are set to provide context and enhance the understanding of the plot.
Formatting and Display: The plot is formatted with a consistent visual style and gridlines for better readability. Layout adjustments are made to prevent overlapping elements and ensure a visually appealing presentation.
Export Options: The plot can be saved as an image file for further analysis and interpretation.
Usage:
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Run the provided Python script to generate the visualization.
Customize the script with your own data or modify the plot settings as needed.
Save the plot as an image file or integrate it into your project as required.

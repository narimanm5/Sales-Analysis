# Sales and Customer Data Visualization

This project utilizes Matplotlib to create a visual representation of sales data alongside daily customer counts and working days over a period of several months. The aim is to provide stakeholders with insights into sales performance and customer engagement metrics, facilitating informed decision-making and business analysis.

## Features

- **Dual-Axis Plot**: Sales data is represented as vertical bars on the primary axis, while daily customer counts and working days are plotted on the secondary axis using distinct marker styles and colors.
- **Annotations**: Annotations are strategically placed on the plot to display the exact values of daily customer counts and working days below the corresponding markers, enhancing data interpretation.
- **Legend and Labels**: Legends are added to both axes to identify the datasets being visualized, and axes labels and a title are set to provide context and improve understanding.
- **Consistent Visual Style**: The plot is formatted with a consistent visual style, including a predefined theme and gridlines for better readability.
- **Export as Image**: The generated plot can be saved as an image file for further analysis or inclusion in reports and presentations.
